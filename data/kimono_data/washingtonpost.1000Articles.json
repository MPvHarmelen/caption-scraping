He quoted the president as saying Fordow was unnecessary if the Iranian program was peaceful. Now they are getting to keep it. All of this leads Menendez — and many other critics of the serial concessions — to ask: If after a decade of pressure and sanctions, Iran has not come clean on PMDs or dismantled its program or allowed anywhere/anytime inspections, why in the world would the regime do so after we lift sanctions?

I agree with much of this analysis, as certainly Chad’s development appears to be a missed opportunity.

As the final tally came down Thursday, the archrivals together booked more than $107 billion in orders and commitments in the biennial gathering’s first four days. Airbus racked up $57 billion in business for 421 aircraft. The announcement of a provisional deal by European low-cost carrier Wizz Air for 110 A321neos — worth more than $12.5 billion at list prices — put the Toulouse, France-based plane maker over the top against Boeing in financial terms. It was the show’s single biggest order. Chicago-based Boeing tallied orders and commitments for 331 planes worth $50.2 billion. Its biggest deal was with Dutch leasing company AerCap for 100 737MAX-8 planes, worth up to $10.7 billion at list prices. Customers routinely negotiate discounts off those list prices.","index":1468,"url":"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/worries-about-greece-prompt-emergency-euro-zone-meeting/2015/06/18/35311de4-15f5-11e5-89f3-61410da94eb1_story.html"},{"text":"— From news services","index":1469,"url":"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/worries-about-greece-prompt-emergency-euro-zone-meeting/2015/06/18/35311de4-15f5-11e5-89f3-61410da94eb1_story.html"},{"text":"● Earnings: CarMax.","index":1470,"url":"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/worries-about-greece-prompt-emergency-euro-zone-meeting/2015/06/18/35311de4-15f5-11e5-89f3-61410da94eb1_story.html"},{"text":"","index":1471,"url":"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/worries-about-greece-prompt-emergency-euro-zone-meeting/2015/06/18/35311de4-15f5-11e5-89f3-61410da94eb1_story.html"},{"text":"","index":1472,"url":"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/worries-about-greece-prompt-emergency-euro-zone-meeting/2015/06/18/35311de4-15f5-11e5-89f3-61410da94eb1_story.html"},{"text":"","index":1473,"url":"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/worries-about-greece-prompt-emergency-euro-zone-meeting/2015/06/18/35311de4-15f5-11e5-89f3-61410da94eb1_story.html"},{"text":"","index":1474,"url":"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/worries-about-greece-prompt-emergency-euro-zone-meeting/2015/06/18/35311de4-15f5-11e5-89f3-61410da94eb1_story.html"},{"text":"","index":1475,"url":"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/worries-about-greece-prompt-emergency-euro-zone-meeting/2015/06/18/35311de4-15f5-11e5-89f3-61410da94eb1_story.html"},{"text":"","index":1476,"url":"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/worries-about-greece-prompt-emergency-euro-zone-meeting/2015/06/18/35311de4-15f5-11e5-89f3-61410da94eb1_story.html"},{"text":"","index":1477,"url":"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/worries-about-greece-prompt-emergency-euro-zone-meeting/2015/06/18/35311de4-15f5-11e5-89f3-61410da94eb1_story.html"},{"text":{"href":"","text":"The National Constitution Center has just posted a podcast on this week’s important Supreme Court decisions.

Relatedly, what about Hill v. Colorado? In that case, the Court held that a restriction on approaching within eight feet of patients outside health care facilities “for the purpose of … engaging in oral protest, education, or counseling” was content-neutral. Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, and Justice Kennedy both dissented, arguing (among other things) that the restriction was actually content-based. The majority opinion in Reed cited, and seemingly endorsed, both of the Hill dissents, but not the Hill majority. If I were the American Center for Law & Justice, which lost in Hill v. Colorado, I would quickly file a fresh challenge to the Colorado statute, arguing that Reed implicitly overrules the logic of the Hill majority opinion; and while lower courts might be reluctant to accept this argument, since Reed doesn’t expressly overrule Hill, it does look likelier than ever that there are now at least five votes on the Court for such an overruling."},"index":2496,"url":"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/06/18/supreme-court-reaffirms-broad-prohibition-on-content-based-speech-restrictions-in-todays-reed-v-town-of-gilbert-decision/"},{"text":{"href":"","text":"8.
